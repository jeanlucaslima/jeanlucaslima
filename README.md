### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Nice to meet you. 

My name is Jean Lucas. I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil [(GMT-3)](https://time.is/GMT-3). 

I work with technology since 2010, been dooing applications for web, and even for some hardware problems. Since 2014 I've been focusing on web projects, using technologies like JavaScript, Ember.js, React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Elixir. 

## What I am looking for

I really dig projects that really value user experience first. I love all phases of a project, from a napkin idea to scaling a project to thousands of users. Some technologies I'm looking forward to work with:

* Go
* JavaScript

I'm also open to collaborate in open source projects!

## What I'm up to right now

* I'm work with [Bad Gateway](https://badgateway.net/), but open for new projects.
* I'm volunteering with [Curveball.js](https://curveballjs.org/), a library to build better Node APIs without Express.
