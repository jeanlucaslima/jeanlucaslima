### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Nice to meet you. 

My name is Jean Lucas. I live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil [(GMT-3)](https://time.is/GMT-3). 

I work with technology since 2010, been dooing applications for web, and even for some hardware problems. Since 2014 I've been focusing on web projects, using technologies like JavaScript, Ember.js, React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Elixir. 

## What I am looking for

I really dig projects that want to make user lives better. Doesn't really matter if it's an early stage or more mature project. I'm always happy to talk, even if just for an opinion. 

~I'm also open to collaborate in open source projects!~ Currently I'm dedicated to a new project.

## What I'm up to right now

* Right now I'm being CTO at a Brazilian startup called [Dei Um Tempo](https://deiumtempo.com) where we help people get rid of unwanted habits.
